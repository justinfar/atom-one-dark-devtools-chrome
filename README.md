# Atom One Dark - Chrome DevTools Theme
Created an Atom One Dark theme to match my terminal and editor. Based off of [Zero Dark Matrix](https://github.com/mauricecruz/chrome-devtools-zerodarkmatrix-theme) Chrome extension.

Instructions for creating and installing the custom theme were found at http://s10wen.com/blog/2014/03/12/chrome-dev-tools-theming-with-zero-base-themes.
